# Personal Portfolio

### about
A ***Personal Portfolio*** designed to showcase my evergrowing skills and projects.

This project utilizes `JavaScript`, `React`, and the `React Icons Library` to create an easily managed and composible design. Design aspects are implemented through `SCSS`, with animations conducted with the `Framer-Motion` library. 

Visitors have the opportunity to contact the developer directly through the `Formspree API`.
